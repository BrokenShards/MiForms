# MiForms
A basic set of Windows Forms controls for use with SFML.

MiForms was written solely for my own use for my own projects.

## Dependencies
- SFML.Net `https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net.git`

## Usage
To get the best use of MiForms, it is highly reccomended that you clone the project and add it to
your solution, then, in Visual Studio, go to `Tools->Options->Windows Forms Designer->General` and
make sure that `Automatically Populate Toolbox` is set to true, this way, MiForms controls will
appear in your Toolbox after it is built.

## Changelog
